JZ Creative Company
About the website.
I have 5 pages in my page, Cover, Home, Protfolio, About, and Contact. I added a Cover page to display some of my most proud work to show the end user, I used the Carousel feature from Bootstrap, it's a slide show, and overall I think a cover page is a really cool feature to add to your website. For the home page, I put different categories of my work to show the end user, what kind of work do I do, I used grid to style it. For the portfolio page, I went a bit crazy with grid, because I named my website "The Creaticy Company", I want my portfolio page look unique, so I used grid for different section, and the style of the top and bottom section are matching, and because of the image looks small on the grid layout I have, so I added animation to it, when you clicking it it will be bigger, and because I have lots of content, so I used Carousel feature from Bootstrap again, just to save some space. For the social media box I have for both of my home and portfolio page, I used different color for each box, I chose some neon color, because the whole website is basiclly white and black, I want to add more style and color to it. And for the About page, I used card from Bootstrap to show my profile, and I made the other images circle on the destop version because this page doesn't have much content, so I want to add more style on this page. For the Contact page I have a map, contact card, and contact form, I think it's important to have a map, it's more convient for the end user than just put my address there, and I only have three input for the contact form, because, first, I think these three input are enough for the end user to contact me, and it also matches the length of the contact card on the left side.

Challenges I faced, and what I learned from them.
The first challenge I faced was the dropdown menu on mobile view, I learned it from Bootstrap, but I can't really center it with either bootstrap or css, so I learned add !important at the end of the code to mke it work. The second challenge I faced was for the social media icons, I used grid area to style it, but it won't center, so I putted it in another div, and used flex to style the big div just to make the content inside could be centered, and used grid area to style the icon group. The third challenge I faced was the the artworks on the portfolio page, the layout before was I have the content side to side, but because I don't have much text, it just looks weird because the picture is way bigger than the text box, doesn't look balance, so I used card instead, and displayed them on one column. What else I learned from this assignment is grid area, because I went with a lot of different styles of grid layout for this assignment, and I found grid area is really useful.
